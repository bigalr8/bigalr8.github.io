    <p>
        Moved From Bridgeport Ct to Phila as a baby. Spent summers in Va. Job relocations 
        took me to Mont. Co. MD., then back to Phila. Then again to Manhattan, commuting 
        there daily from Cheltenham for 10 years. Worked from home after adopting two babies. 
        Stay-at-home dad for past 2 years. Plead guilty to enjoying a CAO Amazon when opportunity 
        arises. On Google daily looking up something. Until recently was also on Udacity daily taking courses.
