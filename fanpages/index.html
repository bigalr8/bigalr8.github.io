            <h2>The J.B.'s</h2>
            The J.B.'s were the legendary supporting cast of musicians behind James Brown, earning a well-deserved
            reputation as the tightest,
            best-drilled instrumental ensemble in all of funk. The name J.B.'s is most often associated with three
            hornmen in particular
            -- saxophonists Maceo Parker and Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis, and trombonist Fred Wesley, all of whom originally
            joined Brown's backing
            band at various points during the '60s. As a recording entity unto themselves, however, the J.B.'s enjoyed a
            distinctly defined heyday
            from 1970-1975, under the musical directorship of Wesley (though Brown, naturally, remained a strong
            presence). The J.B.'s were billed
            under a variety of alternate names on their own singles and albums -- Fred Wesley and the J.B.'s, Maceo and
            the Macks, Fred and the New
            J.B.'s, the James Brown Soul Train, the Last Word, the First Family, and more. The core group of personnel,
            despite some turnover on the
            periphery, remained fairly steady from 1971 on, at least until Brown's creative downturn precipitated
            several important defections.
